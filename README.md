Ocean DeadZone 
This project focuses on detecting and analyzing ocean dead zones using data-driven approaches. Ocean dead zones are areas with low oxygen levels that make it difficult for marine life to survive. The project includes pH level analysis and other relevant parameters to identify potential dead zones.

Features:

->pH Level Analysis: Determines ocean acidity levels.
->Data Processing & Visualization: Parses and visualizes oceanographic data.
->Dead Zone Identification: Uses predefined thresholds to classify affected regions.
